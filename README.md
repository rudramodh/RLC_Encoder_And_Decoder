# RLC Encoder and Decoder

 Developed an algorithm for encoder and decoder to encode binary image using Run Length Coding.


## Description

Encoder reads binary image (png) from disk and generates RLC representation which is then saved to a file. The decoder reads RLC formatted
image and converts it back to an image (BufferedImage).
